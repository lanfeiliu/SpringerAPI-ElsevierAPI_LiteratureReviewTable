Global perspectives on the urban stream syndrome,"Booth D.B., Roy A.H., Smith B., Capps K.A.",Freshwater Science,2016-03-01,12,"Copyright, 2016 by The Society for Freshwater Science.Urban streams commonly express degraded physical, chemical, and biological conditions that have been collectively termed the urban stream syndrome. The description of the syndrome highlights the broad similarities among these streams relative to their less-impaired counterparts. Awareness of these commonalities has fostered rapid improvements in the management of urban stormwater for the protection of downstream watercourses, but the focus on the similarities among urban streams has obscured meaningful differences among them. Key drivers of stream responses to urbanization can vary greatly among climatological and physiographic regions of the globe, and the differences can be manifested in individual stream channels even through the homogenizing veneer of urban development. We provide examples of differences in natural hydrologic and geologic settings (within similar regions) that can result in different mechanisms of stream ecosystem response to urbanization and, as such, should lead to different management approaches. The idea that all urban streams can be cured using the same treatment is simplistic, but overemphasizing the tremendous differences among natural (or human-altered) systems also can paralyze management. Thoughtful integration of work that recognizes the commonalities of the urban stream syndrome across the globe has benefitted urban stream management. Now we call for a more nuanced understanDing of the regional, subregional, and local attributes of any given urban stream and its watershed to advance the physical, chemical, and ecological recovery of these systems.",None,None,None
Thermal performance improvement of a horizontal ground-coupled heat exchanger by rainwater harvest,"Gao Y., Fan R., Li H., Liu R., Lin X., Guo H., Gao Y.",Energy and Buildings,2016-01-01,4,"Copyright, 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. Increased moisture content leads to increased thermal conductivity and is beneficial for heat exchange of ground-coupled heat exchangers (GCHE). In this study, a horizontal GCHE was combined with a rain garden, characterized by the beneficial supply of rainwater to groundwater, increased soil moisture content and favorable conditions for GCHE. Sandy soil container experiment results showed that water immigration was possible under thermal action of the horizontal GCHE. Compared with little water transfer under the heat evacuation condition, with a relatively small temperature difference between fluid and adjacent soils, heat and water transfer were coupled under the heat rejection condition and a drying region appeared at regions adjacent to the tube wall because of the relatively large temperature difference. Water immigration was more likely to occur when sandy soil had low moisture content, for example 0.1 m3/m3. The coupled heat and water transfer model was necessary for prediction of horizontal GCHE thermal performance. Under high moisture content conditions, the coupled model was dispensable but it was necessary to consider moisture-dependent variation in thermal conductivity.",None,None,None
Modeling flood reduction effects of low impact development at a watershed scale,"Ahiablame L., Shakya R.",Journal of Environmental Management,2016-04-15,2,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Low impact development (LID) is a land development approach that seeks to mimic a site's pre-development hydrology. This study is a case study that assessed flood reduction capabilities of large-scale adoption of LID practices in an urban watershed in central Illinois using the Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM). Two flood metrics based on runoff discharge were developed to determine action flood (43 m3/s) and major flood (95 m3/s). Four land use scenarios for urban growth were evaluated to determine the impacts of urbanization on runoff and flooding. Flood attenuation effects of porous pavement, rain barrel, and rain garden at various application levels were also evaluated as retrofitting technologies in the study watershed over a period of 30 years. Simulation results indicated that increase in urban land use from 50 to 94% between 1992 and 2030 increased average annual runoff and flood events by more than 30%, suggesting that urbanization without sound management would increase flood risks. The various implementation levels of the three LID practices resulted in 3-47% runoff reduction in the study watershed. Flood flow events that include action floods and major floods were also reduced by 0-40%, indicating that LID practices can be used to mitigate flood risk in urban watersheds.

"Impact of residential prairie gardens on the physical properties of urban soil in Madison, Wisconsin","Johnston M.R., Balster N.J., Zhu J.",Journal of Environmental Quality,2016-01-01,2,"Copyright, American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA. Prairie gardens have become a common addition to residential communities in the midwestern United States because prairie vegetation is native to the region, requires fewer resources to maintain than turfgrass, and has been promoted to help remediate urban soil. Although prairie systems typically have deeper and more diverse root systems than traditional turfgrass, no one has tested the effect of this vegetation type on the physical properties of urban soil. We hypothesized that residential prairie gardens would yield lower soil bulk density (BD), lower penetration resistance (PR), greater soil organic matter (SOM), and greater saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) compared with turfgrass lawns. To test this hypothesis, we examined 12 residential properties in Madison, WI, where homeowners had established a prairie garden within their turfgrass lawn. Despite a consistent trend in the difference between vegetation types, no significant main effects were found (i.e., a difference between vegetation types when averaged over depth) for any of the four soil properties measured in this study. Differences were found with depth and depended on a significant interaction with vegetation type. At the surface depth (0-0.15 m), soil beneath prairie gardens had 10% lower mean BD, 15% lower mean PR, 25% greater level of SOM, and 33% greater Ksat compared with soil beneath the adjacent lawns. These differences were not detected at deeper sampling intervals of 0.15 to 0.30 m and 0.30 to 0.45 m. Although not statistically significant, the consistent trend and direction among soil variables suggest that residential prairie gardens had changed the surface soil at a rate that marginally outpaced turfgrass and calls for controlled experiments to identify the mechanisms that might enhance these trends."," Despite a consistent trend in the difference between vegetation types, no significant main effects were found (i",None," Although not statistically significant, the consistent trend and direction among soil variables suggest that residential prairie gardens had changed the surface soil at a rate that marginally outpaced turfgrass and calls for controlled experiments to identify the mechanisms that might enhance these trends"
A unified look at phosphorus treatment using bioretention,"Li J., Davis A.P.",Water Research,2016-03-01,2,"Copyright, 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Phosphorus (P) is a water pollutant of significant concern as it limits the productivity of most freshwater systems, which can undergo eutrophication under heavy phosphorus inputs. Bioretention has shown great potential for stormwater quantity and quality control. However, phosphorus removal has been inconsistent in bioretention systems, with phosphorus leaching observed in some systems. This paper examines P removal mechanisms and performance in bioretention systems through published data. A temporal concept of P fate for different time-scales is proposed. A model is developed to predict effluent P concentrations (Ce) based on a media equilibrium concentration (Ceq) assumption, which is suitable for both short and long-term simulation. Ceq is well correlated with Ce for P data for different time-scales. Ceq varies less in media containing Al and Fe than in typical bioretention soil media. Although significant change in Ceq may occur during an event and long-term, Ceq variation in short-term is small. During the event and short terms, for high-P containing media, the concentration relationship is Ceq &gt; Ce &gt; C0 (influent P concentrations); for low-P containing media, Ceq &lt; Ce &lt; C0. During long-term, as media equilibrates with the influent runoff, Ceq ‚âà Ce ‚âà C0. The model explains concentration changes of P with depth. With proper selection of media and amendments, Ceq can be driven towards zero for P in bioretention media."," Phosphorus (P) is a water pollutant of significant concern as it limits the productivity of most freshwater systems, which can undergo eutrophication under heavy phosphorus inputs",None,None

Factorial two-Stage irrigation system optimization model,"Xin X., Huang G., Sun W., Zhou Y., Fan Y.",Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering,2016-01-01,2,"Copyright, 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers. This study proposes a factorial two-stage irrigation system optimization model (FTIM) for supporting agricultural irrigation water-resource management under uncertainty. The FTIM incorporates fractional factorial design, two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), interval linear programming (ILP), and interval probability and is applied to agricultural water allocation. The FTIM can take full advantage of conventional two-stage optimization approaches to tackle uncertainties presented as intervals, to investigate potential interactions among input parameters and their influences on system performance, and to enhance applicability to dual uncertainties expressed as interval probabilities. The proposed FTIM approach is for the first time applied to a hypothetical case study of water resource allocation in an agricultural irrigation problem. The results indicate that the effects of parameters on the objective function are evaluated quantitatively, which can help decision makers screen out significant parameters, analyze their interactions in model response, and identify possible schemes with maximized net system benefit. Especially for the study problem, the most positive significant factor affecting total net benefits is water quality at a medium flow; penalties resulting from undelivered water and benefit rates of onion farms in both periods have negative effects."," The results indicate that the effects of parameters on the objective function are evaluated quantitatively, which can help decision makers screen out significant parameters, analyze their interactions in model response, and identify possible schemes with maximized net system benefit",None,None

Improving evapotranspiration mechanisms in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's storm water management model,"Feng Y., Burian S.",Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,2016-10-01,1,"Copyright, 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Most stormwater models oversimplify evapotranspiration (ET) processes, which restricts their applications in water budget analyses, ecosystem services assessments, and coupled modeling studies such as with urban climate models to investigate benefits of green infrastructure (GI) implementation. To address this need, the Penman-Monteith scheme was incorporated into the United States Environmental Protection Agency's storm water management model (SWMM) to improve the latter's ET routine. The modified SWMM allows heterogeneous and subdaily potential ET (PET) inputs, and includes the effects of water stress on actual ET (AET). The updated ET routine was validated for GI, including bioretention (R2 = 0.57) and green roof (R2 = 0.78), by comparing with direct measurements. A case study showed the upgraded SWMM model generates improved daily ET estimates and more accurate temporal patterns than previous SWMM versions. The results also suggest that water cycle fluxes could be miscalculated if a homogeneous potential ET is used in SWMM and other stormwater models. For example, the annual percolation and AET amounts could be overestimated and underestimated by 406% and 9% respectively for landscapes, and the annual AET and runoff amounts could be overestimated and underestimated by 12-19% and 14-19% respectively for GI, if the mismatched PET time series is used.",None,None, The results also suggest that water cycle fluxes could be miscalculated if a homogeneous potential ET is used in SWMM and other stormwater models
Quantifying volume reduction and peak flow mitigation for three bioretention cells in clay soils in northeast Ohio,"Winston R.J., Dorsey J.D., Hunt W.F.",Science of the Total Environment,2016-05-15,1,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier B.V. Green infrastructure aims to restore watershed hydrologic function by more closely mimicking pre-development groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration (ET). Bioretention has become a popular stormwater control due to its ability to reduce runoff volume through these pathways. Three bioretention cells constructed in low permeability soils in northeast Ohio were monitored for non-winter quantification of inflow, drainage, ET, and exfiltration. The inclusion of an internal water storage (IWS) zone allowed the three cells to reduce runoff by 59%, 42%, and 36% over the monitoring period, in spite of the tight underlying soils. The exfiltration rate and the IWS zone thickness were the primary determinants of volume reduction performance. Post-construction measured drawdown rates were higher than pre-construction soil vertical hydraulic conductivity tests in all cases, due to lateral exfiltration from the IWS zones and ET, which are not typically accounted for in pre-construction soil testing. The minimum rainfall depths required to produce outflow for the three cells were 5.5, 7.4, and 13.8 mm. During events with 1-year design rainfall intensities, peak flow reduction varied from 24 to 96%, with the best mitigation during events where peak rainfall rate occurred before the centroid of the rainfall volume, when adequate bowl storage was available to limit overflow.",None,None,None
Hydraulic Performance of a Residential Stormwater Infiltration Gallery,"Jennings A.A., Baker K.",Journal of Environmental Engineering (United States),2016-03-01,1,"Copyright, 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers. An increasing number of municipalities are encouraging homeowners to implement on-site residential stormwater management. In some communities, this encouragement takes the form of a stormwater utility fee or rain tax that may be reduced if homeowners take measures to reduce runoff. The most commonly cited techniques for reducing runoff are disconnecting downspouts or installing rain barrels, rain gardens, or permeable pavements. The analysis presented here examines the hydraulic performance of the less commonly recommended residential stormwater infiltration gallery designed to reduce off-site runoff from roof gutters. Case study simulation results based on a 10-year precipitation record for Cleveland, Ohio, indicate that a 30-m (100-ft) infiltration gallery sitting atop soil with a modest infiltration rate of 0.64 cm/h (0.25 in./h) could attain a single downspout roof service-area runoff reduction of 90%, and a 61-m (200-ft) gallery could attain a whole roof runoff reduction of more than 85%. This performance is superior to that expected from rain barrels or modest-size rain gardens, and the operation-free and low-maintenance gallery would address many of the concerns often expressed by homeowners about other stormwater-management options.",None,None,None
Significant Reduction of Fecal Bacteria and Suspended Solids Loading by Coastal Best Management Practices,"Mallin M.A., Turner M.I.H., McIver M.R., Toothman B.R., Freeman H.C.",Journal of Coastal Research,2016-07-01,0,"Copyright,  Town of Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, is a resort island that has periodic stormwater runoff problems, affecting local swimming and shellfishing waters from excessive fecal bacteria loading. In 2013-15, the planning, installation, and before-and-after monitoring of several types of best management practices (BMPs) designed to reduce pollutant loading to estuarine waters occurred. A straight pipe carrying runoff directly into estuarine Banks Channel was replaced by a buried infiltration chamber. The infiltration chamber did not reduce fecal bacteria concentrations but caused 93% stormwater discharge reduction, 96% fecal bacteria, 90% Enterococcus load reductions, and a 99% total suspended solids (TSS) load reduction to Banks Channel. Near the town's municipal area a number of curb cuts, reversed stormwater inlets, and regraded grassed swales were constructed to encourage infiltration of stormwater into the sandy soils of the island. Also in that area a large rain garden was constructed to collect and infiltrate stormwater that formerly drained directly into estuarine Lee's Cut. The set of stormwater volume reduction and treatment BMPs in the municipal area caused fecal coliform bacteria and Enterococcus concentration reductions of 57% and 71%, respectively, 50% stormwater discharge reduction, 28-55% fecal bacteria load reductions, and 99% TSS load reduction. The pollutant concentration and load decreases in the municipal area of Wrightsville Beach are particularly striking because the BMPs only capture about 50% of the runoff from the drainage area that enters the outfall into Lee's Cut.

Identifying Potential Areas for SUDS Application in Consolidated Urban Watersheds Based on GIS,"Avila H., Amaris G., Buelvas J.","World Environmental And Water Resources Congress 2016: Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater and Urban Watershed Symposium - Papers from Sessions of the Proceedings of the 2016 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, ASCE. Gray stormwater infrastructure has a specific hydraulic capacity, which tends to get undersized when receiving the incremental input flow rate coming from new developed areas or from changes in the land use. Implementing sustainable urban drainage systems - SUDS in consolidated urban watersheds is a feasible alternative that allows managing stormwater runoff combined with the traditional infrastructure. However, its use on a massive scale in cities is a challenge for urban planning. This article shows the results from a research oriented to identifying potential areas for applying SUDS as a support for urban planning in order to define strategies for potential application of rain gardens, permeable paving, storage tanks and green roofs by using models from GIS. A case study was conducted to 10 watersheds in Barranquilla (Colombia), which has severe stormwater issues related to runoff volume and peak flow, and where SUDS may be a feasible alternative for runoff management. Physical conditions of the watershed, such as the type of soil, the water table and slope, socio-economic characteristics, land use and other environmental variables were analyzed in a decision making framework model implemented in GIS.

Phosphorus removal in constructed stormwater wetland mesocosms amended with water treatment residuals,"Vacca K., Komlos J., Wadzuk B.M.",Water Environment Research,2016-09-01,0,"Copyright, 2016, Water Environment Federation. All rights reserved. Constructed stormwater wetlands (CSWs) reduce stormwater volume and improve water quality. One quality improvement is the removal of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). There has been limited study on SRP fate and transport or on the mechanisms to improve SRP removal due to the difficulty in quantifying the complex, spatially heterogeneous removal processes in two-dimensional flow. The present research analyzed the ability of wetland soil (Control) and wetland soil amended with 2%, 5%, and 8% (by mass) of aluminum-based water treatment residuals (AlWTRs) to remove SRP in surface-flow vegetated CSW mesocosms. Batch adsorption experiments showed increasing SRP sorption capacity with increased AlWTR content (590-850 mg/kg soil) compared to the Control (385 mg/kg soil); however, AlWTR-amended flowing mesocosms removed only 6.0-8.8 mg/kg SRP compared to 9.3 mg/kg SRP for the Control. The lack of increased SRP removal in AlWTR-amended mesocosms was attributed to flow dynamics (only 20% of the surface outflow was quantified as subsurface flow).

"Distributed stormwater controls for flood mitigation within urbanized watersheds: Case study of Rocky Branch Watershed in Columbia, South Carolina","Morsy M.M., Goodall J.L., Shatnawi F.M., Meadows M.E.",Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,2016-11-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. For highly urbanized watersheds where space is limited, distributed low impact development (LID) stormwater controls could offer an effective retrofit to address flooding problems. The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of using distributed LID controls within an urbanized watershed for flood mitigation. The Rocky Branch Watershed in Columbia, South Carolina, is an excellent case study because it experiences flash floods almost annually and has limited space for traditional, centralized stormwater controls to mitigate these floods. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to model flooding with rain gardens as the LID approach for flood mitigation owing to their storage potential. The results of the study suggest that rain gardens with 30-cm berm heights and a total area equal to 20% of the impervious surfaces within the watershed should provide sufficient storage to mitigate flooding for rain events up to and including a 10-year storm event. Once sufficient storage is available, the challenge is diverting runoff generated from impervious surfaces into rain gardens. The results of this study suggest approximately 15, 27, and 38% of the runoff generated from impervious surfaces should be diverted to rain gardens to mitigate flooding from 2-, 5-, and 10-year storm events, respectively. Given prior work on the adoption of LID approaches for other watersheds, rain gardens could be effective at mitigating up to a 5-year storm event within the watershed, although further research on possible adoption rates in the study watershed is needed to more fully support this conclusion.",None," Given prior work on the adoption of LID approaches for other watersheds, rain gardens could be effective at mitigating up to a 5-year storm event within the watershed, although further research on possible adoption rates in the study watershed is needed to more fully support this conclusion", The results of the study suggest that rain gardens with 30-cm berm heights and a total area equal to 20% of the impervious surfaces within the watershed should provide sufficient storage to mitigate flooding for rain events up to and including a 10-year storm event
Water Balance of Soil Mixes for Rain Gardens,"Hess A., Delvecchio T., Welker A., Wadzuk B.M.","World Environmental And Water Resources Congress 2016: Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater and Urban Watershed Symposium - Papers from Sessions of the Proceedings of the 2016 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, ASCE. Rain gardens have proven to be an effective means to control stormwater; thus, in Pennsylvania's Stormwater Best Management Practice's Manual, rain gardens are the preferred stormwater control measure (SCM). Currently, volume capture in Pennsylvania is calculated using a static bowl equation that does not include the dynamics of infiltration and evapotranspiration (ET). In addition, many states' design guidelines for rain garden soil mixes are often restrictive and vague. The goal of the work described in this paper is to develop guidelines for soil mixes that consider the balance of infiltration and ET using bench-scale experiments at Villanova University. A total of twelve discrete weighing lysimeters were filled with soils that span the lower portion the USDA classification triangle. The lysimeters were divided evenly into two flow path configurations: vertical 46 cm deep columns and horizontal 20 cm deep boxes at a 2.5% slope. Both lysimeter configurations utilized loamy sand, sandy loam (typical rain garden mix in PA), loam, silt loam, and clay loam soils. Switchgrass was planted in all but two lysimeters to provide a non-vegetated control with sandy loam soil. Runoff was added into the lysimeters during rainfall events to simulate actual rain garden performance and the lysimeters were weighed daily for two weeks after the event. Preliminary results of five storm simulations provide an average ET rate of 3.3 mm/day for the vertical lysimeters and 2.6 mm/day for the horizontal lysimeters. In the vertical configuration the silt loam soil produces the most volume removal through ET at 44% of the total volume removal with an average ET rate of 4.2 mm/day.

Bioswale, which is an effective purification measure of urban surface runoff pollutants, was investigated to determine the relationship between bioswale composition and purification. Results indicate that the pollutant removal rate of bioswales decreases with an increase in influent concentration. Various selected vegetation combinations showed no significant difference in terms of pollutant removal in two months after being planted within a single rainfall. Increasing the thickness of the planting soil and artificial filler layers can improve the contaminant removal rate.

The total nitrogen (TN) removal rate increased with submerged zone height, whereas the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorus (TP) showed no significant change. The addition of an external carbon source increased TN concentration removal and decreased COD concentration removal without significantly affecting TP.

Plant evaluation and selection for rain gardens in China,"Liu J., Gao Y., Zhang Q., Bai W., Wang Y., Yang M.",Acta Horticulturae,2016-02-08,0,"Copyright, one of the world most water-scare countries, China expands tons of water in urban public landscape spaces. However, on the other hand, due to natural vegetation being replaced by impervious surface, rainwater directly flows into storm sewers with runoff pollutions, and then it drains off into nearby water bodies without treatment, which results in serious waste of rainwater resources and pollution of the river system. During heavy storms the enormous pressure on municipal storm water treatment installations may give rise to urban waterlogging, even serious localised flooding. The contradiction between water shortage and rain water waste has been an increasingly serious problem. To relieve the contradiction, rain gardens can be a valuable part of changing the above matters. As the principal part of a rain garden, plants play a vital role in the rainwater processing system. However, most of the plants applied to rain gardens in western countries cannot adapt to the climate in China.

T1) are 71%, 1% and 41%, for layered bioretention column with less permeable soil layer (Col. T2) the efficiencies are 83%, 84% and 82%, and for the bioretention column with submerged zone (Col. T3) the values are 63%, 31% and 53%, respectively. The best nitrogen removal is obtained using Col. T2 with relatively low infiltration rate. Adsorption during runoff dosing and nitrification during the drying period are the primary NH4 +‚ÄîN removal pathways. Less permeable soil and the elevated outlet promote the formation of anoxic conditions. 30%‚Äì70% of NO3 ‚àí‚ÄîN applied to columns in a single repetition is denitrified during the draining period, suggesting that the draining period is an important timeframe for the removal of NO3 ‚àí‚ÄîN.

SWMM-based evaluation of the effect of rain gardens on urbanized areas,"Li J., Li Y., Li Y.",Environmental Earth Sciences,2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Taking an area of Xi‚Äôan city as an example, the Storm Water Management Model was established according to the measured data after calibration and validation. Three different return period storms (once in 2¬†years, once in a decade, and once in 20¬†years) were designed to simulate the water quantity and quality of the study area with or without rain gardens. Rain gardens with different proportions (1, 2, and 4¬†%) of the study area were set for simulation and comparison. Finally, the control effects of rain gardens with and without discharge facility were compared. Rain gardens can reduce the total amount and peak flow of urban runoff. Such gardens can also reduce pollutant peak concentration and pollution load. The peak time of flow and concentration can be delayed. However, the control effect or reduction rate of rain gardens will decrease with increasing rainfall intensity. A larger area proportion of rain gardens results in a better control effect on urban runoff. The control effect of rain gardens without discharge facility is better than that of rain gardens with discharge facility under the same conditions of rainfall and area ratio. The control effect difference between rain gardens with and without discharge facility decreases with the increase in the area ratio of rain gardens.",None,None,None

"Escherichia coli removal in copper-zeolite-integrated stormwater biofilters: Effect of vegetation, operational time, intermittent drying weather","Li Y., McCarthy D.T., Deletic A.",Ecological Engineering,2016-05-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier B.V. Existing biofiltration systems have shown variable and often inadequate bacterial removal efficacy. Previous work has shown antimicrobial media copper-zeolite as a promising alternative to reduce the variability and excessive discharge of faecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli. A large-scale biofilter column study was conducted over eight months to investigate the benefits of incorporating copper-zeolite into biofilters on E. coli removal. The incorporation of copper-zeolite into biofilters improved E. coli log removal rate by 53% reducing E. coli concentration from 21,800 MPN/100 mL (median inflow) to 126 MPN/100 mL (median outflow) comparable to international primary contact recreational water quality. In addition, the E. coli removal performance of copper-zeolite amended biofilters increased after intermittent dry weather periods; this is notable, especially considering biofilter performance usually decreases after drying. Furthermore, these designs reduced inflow copper concentration by 91% (comparable to the metal removal performance of traditional biofilters) and provided a median effluent copper concentration of 8 Œºg/L. The vegetation in copper-zeolite filters survived. These results validate the use of copper-zeolite as bioretention media, particularly for sites requiring microbial reduction. Future research will include systematic investigation of the processes involved in reduction of bacteria in copper-zeolite filters and optimise filter design to augment the system performance to meet more stringent stormwater reuse requirements.",None,None,None
Modelling infiltration enhancement in a tropical urban catchment for improved stormwater management,"Chui T.F.M., Trinh D.H.",Hydrological Processes,2016-11-15,0,"Copyright, yright ¬© 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. To mitigate the impacts of impervious surfaces in urban areas, structures such as bioretention systems and permeable pavements have been installed to enhance infiltration in many countries. However, relatively little knowledge is available regarding the performance of such infiltration-based structures in humid tropical and highly urbanized areas. This study investigates the feasibility of enhancing the infiltration of stormwater in tropical urbanized areas using Singapore as a case study. It first shows that the rainfall depth and intensity are both high, but the time interval between consecutive rainfall event is long in Singapore. It then numerically simulates single-event local infiltration and finds that the fraction of infiltrated rainfall is actually high. It finally performs catchment-scale simulations and finds that bioretention systems can enhance infiltration and groundwater recharge particularly during wet periods. However, local mounding of groundwater can be significant and can hinder the performance of those structures. Furthermore, with 5% of catchment area being converted to such structures, the infiltration of the entire catchment is enhanced but still not yet up to the natural level. To increase the overall effectiveness, future studies can look into bioretention systems with underdrain systems.

Bioretention, as a popular low impact development practice, has become more important to mitigate adverse impacts on urban stormwater. However, there is very limited information regarding ensuring the effectiveness of bioretention response to uncertain future challenges, especially when taking into consideration climate change and urbanization. The main objective of this paper is to identify the cost-effectiveness of bioretention by assessing the hydrology performance under future scenarios modeling. First, the hydrology model was used to obtain peak runoff and TSS loads of bioretention with variable scales under different scenarios, i.e., different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio-economic reference Pathways (SSPs) for 2-year and 10-year design storms in Singapore. Then, life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA) were estimated for bioretention, and the cost-effectiveness was identified under different scenarios. Our finding showed that there were different degree of responses to 2-year and 10-year design storms but the general patterns and insights deduced were similar. The performance of bioretenion was more sensitive to urbanization than that for climate change in the urban catchment. In addition, it was noted that the methodology used in this study was generic and the findings could be useful as reference for other LID practices in response to climate change and urbanization.",None,None,None

Small scale green infrastructure design to meet different urban hydrological criteria,"Jia Z., Tang S., Luo W., Li S., Zhou M.",Journal of Environmental Management,2016-04-15,0,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier Ltd. As small scale green infrastructures, rain gardens have been widely advocated for urban stormwater management in the contemporary low impact development (LID) era. This paper presents a simple method that consists of hydrological models and the matching plots of nomographs to provide an informative and practical tool for rain garden sizing and hydrological evaluation. The proposed method considers design storms, infiltration rates and the runoff contribution area ratio of the rain garden, allowing users to size a rain garden for a specific site with hydrological reference and predict overflow of the rain garden under different storms. The nomographs provide a visual presentation on the sensitivity of different design parameters. Subsequent application of the proposed method to a case study conducted in a sub-humid region in China showed that, the method accurately predicted the design storms for the existing rain garden, the predicted overflows under large storm events were within 13-50% of the measured volumes. The results suggest that the nomographs approach is a practical tool for quick selection or assessment of design options that incorporate key hydrological parameters of rain gardens or other infiltration type green infrastructure.

Vegetation type alters surface hydrology and nitrogen (N) cycling by partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) and drainage, but has not been fully utilized for this purpose in the design of urban rain gardens. Replicated treatments of three vegetation types (prairie, shrub, and turfgrass) commonly planted in rain gardens, as well as bare soil (control), were evaluated 1¬†year after establishment in 12, free-drainage bioretention cells designed to specifications for residential rain gardens in the Midwestern United States. Water and N budgets were calculated to assess differences in ET, drainage, soil moisture, and N transport following three stormwater applications in July, August, and October of 2006. Evaporative demand was also estimated as potential or reference ET during the study period using Hamon, Priestley-Taylor, and FAO Penman-Monteith models. Results show that after 1¬†year of establishment, vegetation type changed the water budgets of rain gardens thus altering their provisioning of ecosystem services via observed tradeoffs between daytime evaporative cooling (ET), stormwater storage, N-load reduction, soil and plant N retention, and groundwater recharge (drainage). Vegetation effects on hydrology and N transport were most significant when evaporative demand was high during the middle of the growing season. Observed changes in ET, drainage, soil moisture, and N transport support the incorporation of different vegetation types into conceptual and numerical models of rain gardens to assess ecological outcomes and tradeoffs at a variety of spatiotemporal scales.", Vegetation effects on hydrology and N transport were most significant when evaporative demand was high during the middle of the growing season,None,None

Coupling human preferences with biophysical processes: modeling the effect of citizen attitudes on potential urban stormwater runoff,"Sun N., Hall M.",Urban Ecosystems,2016-12-01,0,"Copyright, 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Green infrastructure (GI) is gaining wide popularity as a means to reduce urban stormwater runoff. The challenges to long-term success of many GI policies, however, depend on citizen understanding and willingness to be engaged in the process of GI implementation. In this study, we developed a conceptual model that incorporated human preferences and biophysical processes in a coupled manner to estimate stormwater runoff variation at the sewershed scale under different acceptable GI implementation scenarios. To investigate resident receptivity toward GI implementation, we conducted surveys in selected Syracuse sewersheds and developed the scenario of residents implementing rain barrels and rain gardens in their private properties based on the survey results. We simulated this scenario at the lot level using the model we developed within the framework of the EPA SWMM 5 model to estimate reductions in peak flow and total runoff volume for major storm events. With our model, we also tested the effect of planned government tree planting scenarios.

Hybrid green infrastructure for reducing demands on urban water and energy systems: a New York City hypothetical case study,"Cherrier J., Klein Y., Link H., Pillich J., Yonzan N.",Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,2016-03-01,0,"Copyright, 2016, AESS. Green infrastructure shows promise as a ‚Äúbest management practice‚Äù for controlling stormwater runoff, particularly in older cities with combined sewer systems. Green infrastructure systems have been used to both mitigate pollutant loading to adjacent waterways as well as to reduce burdens on municipal wastewater and stormwater collection and treatment systems during storm events. Although the electric and water/wastewater networks are closely linked, wastewater, water supply, and energy systems have been typically studied in isolation. Here, we present a hypothetical case study for applying a modular hybrid green infrastructure approach to manage stormwater in the Newtown Creek sewershed in New York City. We provide background information on current and projected stormwater flows to the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and evaluate how interception and storage rainwater in the Newtown Creek sewershed could offset inflows to the WWTP and how this offset of stormwater inflows might result in reduced electric grid burdens and cost savings for the city. Our assessment indicates that a 0.66¬†% conversion of impervious sewershed surface area to modular hybrid green infrastructure could reduce stormwater inflow volumes (i.e., for an annual median storm) to the Newtown Creek WWTP by 10¬†%.

Personal Computer Stormwater Management Model (PCSWMM) was applied to investigate: (1) hydrological responses in the Myponga catchment as a result of land use changes; and (2) the possibility of adopting Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) technologies (bio-retention cells) to manage resulting floods. Calibrated and validated models predicted the measured data with satisfactory accuracy and reliability. Different urbanization scenarios were tested.

Frequency of flood at 2-year Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) increased from 1 to 44 and frequency of floods at 100-year ARI increased from none to 8. At 70% urbanisation, trialled bio-retention facilities used as WSUD measures almost completely ameliorated 2-year ARI floods by reducing the frequency of such events from 44 to 2. Floods at smaller ARIs (2, 5, 10 and 20 years) were effectively managed by WSUD measures while floods at 50- and 100-year ARIs remained unchanged.

Household response to environmental incentives for rain garden adoption,"Newburn D.A., Alberini A.",Water Resources Research,2016-02-01,0,"Copyright, 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. A decentralized approach to encourage the voluntary adoption of household stormwater management practices is increasingly needed to mitigate urban runoff and to comply with more stringent water quality regulations. We analyze the household response to a hypothetical rebate program to incentivize rain garden adoption using household survey data from the Baltimore-Washington corridor. We asked respondents whether the household would adopt a rain garden without a rebate or when offered a randomly assigned rebate. An interval-data model is used to estimate household demand on the willingness to pay (WTP) for a rain garden as a function of demographic factors, gardening activities, environmental attitudes, and other household characteristics. Estimation results indicate that mean WTP for a rain garden in our sample population is approximately 6.72 per square foot, corresponding to almost three-fourths of the installation cost. The expected adoption rate more than tripled when comparing no rebate versus a government rebate set at one-third of the installation cost, indicating that economic incentives matter. There is substantial heterogeneity in the WTP among households. Higher levels of WTP are estimated for households with higher environmental concern for the Chesapeake Bay and local streams, garden experience, higher income, and non-senior citizen adults. We conclude that a cost-share rebate approach is likely to significantly affect household adoption decisions, and the partial contributions paid by households can assist with lowering the substantial compliance costs for local governments to meet water quality requirements."," We conclude that a cost-share rebate approach is likely to significantly affect household adoption decisions, and the partial contributions paid by households can assist with lowering the substantial compliance costs for local governments to meet water quality requirements"," We conclude that a cost-share rebate approach is likely to significantly affect household adoption decisions, and the partial contributions paid by households can assist with lowering the substantial compliance costs for local governments to meet water quality requirements",None

CS is defined as the stormwater collection and water supply infrastructure, and the conventional landscaping choices in the City of Atlanta. The study scope is limited to five single-family residential zones (SFZs), classified R-1 through R-5, and four multi-family residential zones (MFZs), classified RG-2 through RG-5. Population density increases from 0.4 (R-1) to 62.2 (RG-5) persons per 1,000 m2. We performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparison of CS and HS using TRACI 2.1 to simulate impacts on the ecosystem, human health, and natural resources.We quantified the impact of freshwater consumption using the freshwater ecosystem impact (FEI) indicator. Test results indicate that HS has a higher LCA single score than CS in zones with a low population density; however, the difference becomes negligible as population density increases. Incorporating LID in SFZs and MFZs can reduce potable water use by an average of 50% and 25%, respectively; however, water savings are negligible in zones with high population density (i.e., RG-5) due to the diminished surface area per capita available for LID technologies.

As a consequence of increased urbanization, floods threaten inhabitants of various cities in Japan. Although a conventional way of treating urban flooding is to construct sewage systems, alternative approaches have to be developed because of their expense in the context of the current financial crisis, especially in local governments.

This study shows that rain gardens are suitable for dealing with low flow volumes of rainwater, although their suitability could be slightly changed by soil properties and catchment area. Our field survey indicated that rain gardens must be connected to a sewage system. In addition, like other green infrastructure, rain gardens require maintenance. The most frequent type of maintenance is the disposal of garbage, as garbage can block channels running between a rain garden and a conventional sewage system.

An efficiency booster for energy conversion in natural circulation loops,"Wang D., Jiang J.",Nuclear Engineering and Design,2016-08-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. In this paper, the capacity of a natural circulation loop for transferring heat from a heat source to a heat sink has been analyzed.

The low conversion efficiency leading to weak driving force in such loops has been demonstrated analytically and validated through simulation results. This issue has resulted in a low heat transfer capacity in the circulation loop. To increase the heat transfer capacity, one has to improve this efficiency.

Redox dynamics and oxygen reduction rates of infiltrating urban stormwater beneath low impact development (LID),"Danfoura M.N., Gurdak J.J.",Water (Switzerland),2016-10-04,0,"Copyright, 2016 by the authors. Low impact development (LID) best management practices (BMPs) collect, infiltrate, and treat stormwater runoff, and increase recharge to aquifers. Understanding the controls on reduction/oxidation (redox) conditions within LID BMPs is important for groundwater management because outflow from some LID BMPs can recharge aquifers and affect groundwater quality. Here we evaluate redox conditions of urban stormwater runoff in a LID infiltration trench in San Francisco, California, and quantify the relation between water saturation (%) and temperature (¬∞C) and resulting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, redox dynamics, and O2 reduction rates. The DO fluctuations have an inverse response to the duration of saturation of the trench. Anoxic (&lt; 0.5 mg/L) conditions often occurred within hours of stormwater events and persisted from a few hours to two days, which indicate that microbial respiration can be a limiting factor for DO. Temperature of stormwater runoff was not a statistically significant control on DO. The estimated O2 reduction rate is 0.003 mg¬∑L-1¬∑min-1, which is two to five orders of magnitude higher than in groundwater from previous studies. Higher rates of O2 reduction are a function of the more oxic and organic-rich stormwater runoff that drives faster microbial O2 reduction.

Nitrogen-cycling process rates across urban ecosystems,"Reisinger A.J., Groffman P.M., Rosi-Marshall E.J.",FEMS Microbiology Ecology,2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, FEMS 2016. Nitrogen (N) pollution of freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems is widespread and has numerous environmental and economic impacts. A portion of this excess N comes from urban watersheds comprised of natural and engineered ecosystems that can alter downstream N export. Studies of urban N cycling have focused on either specific ecosystems or on watershed-scale mass balances. Comparisons of specific N transformations across ecosystems are required to contextualize rates from individual studies. Here we reviewed urban N cycling in terrestrial, aquatic and engineered ecosystems, and compared N processing in these urban ecosystem types to native reference ecosystems. We found that net N mineralization and net nitrification rates were enhanced in urban forests and riparian zones relative to reference ecosystems. Denitrification was highly variable across urban ecosystem types, but no significant differences were found between urban and reference denitrification rates. When focusing on urban streams, ammonium uptake was more rapid than nitrate uptake in urban streams. Additionally, reduction of stormwater runoff coupled with potential decreases in N concentration suggests that green infrastructure may reduce downstream N export. Despite multiple environmental stressors in urban environments, ecosystems within urban watersheds can process and transform N at rates similar to or higher than reference ecosystems."," Denitrification was highly variable across urban ecosystem types, but no significant differences were found between urban and reference denitrification rates",None," Additionally, reduction of stormwater runoff coupled with potential decreases in N concentration suggests that green infrastructure may reduce downstream N export"

Hydrological regulation performances of LID practices based on different rainfall reappearance periods,"Sun Y., Pomeroy C.A., Lu S., Xu C.",Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society for Agricultural Machinery,2016-06-25,0,"Copyright, 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved. Urbanization caused hydrological change and increased stormwater runoff volumes, which led to flooding, erosion and the degradation of instream ecosystem health. Low impact development (LID) options had been proposed as an alternative approach to mimic the natural flow regime by using decentralized designs to control stormwater runoff at the source, rather than at a centralized location in the watershed. Hydrological regulation performances of these LID practices can be influenced by rainfall characteristics, such as rainfall intensity and duration. To evaluate the impacts of different rainfall reappearance periods, rainfall analysis was conducted to determine the rainfall characteristics and SCS II type was selected for the analysis. A modeling approach based on SWMM was described to incorporate these LID practices into an existing hydrological model to estimate the impacts of LID practices on the surface runoff. Results demonstrated that the LID practices led to significant stormwater control for different rainfall reappearance periods. Hydrological regulation performances of the LID practices were varied with rainfall reappearance periods. For LID practices with the same surface area, the detention pond performed the best in reducing peak flow rate, which was followed by infiltration trench, bioretention cell and porous pavement. Detention pond was capable to reduce the peak flow rate of 100-year storm to the value of 10-year storm, indicating significant performances. Differences in peak flow reduction were due to structure differences in the LID practices. For the infiltration regulation performances, infiltration trench had the highest recharge ratio for all the rainfall reappearance periods, followed by bioretention cell and porous pavement. Porous pavement, though made of 100% pervious material, infiltrated small runoff which was limited by the native soil infiltration rate when the rainfall volume exceeded the storage capacity. Deep analysis was conducted to determine the reasons that the LID practices performed differently when they had the same surface area. Results showed that the ""effective storage"", which was the water volume that a facility can contain, was the crucial factor. When rainfall intensity was larger than native soil infiltration rate, the excessive water was stored in the facility, and then it was released or infiltrated to the groundwater, depending on the facility structure. Consequently, the water exceeded the ""effective storage"" was flowed over the LID practices and made contribution to the surface runoff directly. Calculation results showed that the ""effective storage"" for the detention pond was 1861.20 m3, which was the largest among the four LID practices, and it explained the reason that detention pond worked the best in peak flow reduction. The ""effective storage"" for the infiltration trench, porous pavement and bioretention cell were 744.48 m3, 80.37 m3 and 565.14 m3, respectively.", Results demonstrated that the LID practices led to significant stormwater control for different rainfall reappearance periods,None,None
Laboratory study of infiltration into two frozen engineered (sandy) soils recommended for bioretention,"Moghadas S., Gustafsson A.-M., Viklander P., Marsalek J., Viklander M.",Hydrological Processes,2016-04-15,0,"Copyright, 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Infiltration of water into two frozen engineered soils of different gradation was studied in laboratory soil columns 1.2m long and 0.1m in diameter. Prior to testing, the soil moisture was adjusted to two levels, described by the gravimetric water content of 5% or 10%, and soils were compacted to about 80-90% of the maximum dry density and refrigerated to temperatures ranging from -8 to -2¬∞C. Water with temperatures 8-9¬∞C was thereafter fed on the top of columns at a constant head, and the times of water breakthrough in the column and reaching a steady percolation rate, as well as the percolation rate, were recorded. The soil water content was a critical factor affecting the thawing process; during freezing, soil moisture was converted into ice, which blocked pores, and its melting required high amounts of energy supplied by infiltrating water. Hence, the thawing of soils with higher initial water content was much slower than in lower moisture soils, and water breakthrough and the attainment of steady percolation required much longer times in higher moisture soils. Heat transfer between infiltrating water, soil ice, and frozen soil particles was well described by the energy budget equations, which constitute a parsimonious model of the observed processes. The finer grained soil and more compacted soil columns exhibited reduced porosity and required longer times for soil thawing. Practical implications of study results for design of bioretention facilities (BFs) in cold climate include the use of coarse engineered soils and fitting bioretention facilities with a drain facilitating soil drainage before the onset of freezing weather.",None,None,None

Evaluation of the capability of low-impact development practices for the removal of heavy metal from urban stormwater runoff,"Maniquiz-Redillas M.C., Kim L.-H.",Environmental Technology (United Kingdom),2016-09-16,0,"Copyright, 2016 Taylor &amp; Francis. ABSTRACT: Low-impact development (LID) and green infrastructure (GI) have recently become well-known methods to capture, collect, retain, and remove pollutants in stormwater runoff. The research was conducted to assess the efficiency of LID/GI systems applied in removing the particulate and dissolved heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, Cd, and Fe) from urban stormwater runoff. A total of 82 storm events were monitored over a four-year period (2010‚Äì2014) on six LID/GI systems including infiltration trenches, tree box filter, rain garden, and hybrid constructed wetlands employed for the management of road, parking lot, and roof runoff. It was observed that the heavy metal concentration increased proportionally with the total suspended solids concentration. Among the heavy metal constituents, Fe appeared to be highly particulate-bound and was the easiest to remove followed by Zn and Pb; while metals such as Cr, Ni, Cu, and Cd were mostly dissolved and more difficult to remove. The mass fraction ratios of metal constituents at the effluent were increased relative to the influent. All the systems performed well in the removal of particulate-bound metals and were more efficient for larger storms greater than 15‚ÄÖmm wherein more particulate-bound metals were generated compared to smaller storms less than 5‚ÄÖmm that produced more dissolved metals. The efficiency of the systems in removing the particulate-bound metals was restricted during high average/peak flows; that is, high-intensity storms events and when heavy metals have low concentration levels.",None,None,None

Construction of the urban water environmental pollution control system based on the ecological ideas of water sensitive urban design,"Wang X.F., Liu H., Yuan X.Z., Ren H.Q., Yue J.S., Xiong S.",Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, 2015, Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.For the first time in history, the majority of the world‚Äôs population is located in urban areas. This milestone marks a critical turning point that will dramatically affect land and water environments. Increasingly, our cities need to be designed for adaptability and resilience to the impacts of population growth, urban densification, and increase in impervious areas, on the urban water environment. The water sensitive urban design (WSUD) has evolved from its early association with stormwater management to provide a broader framework for sustainable design and urban water management. It provides a common and unified method for integrating the interactions between the urban built form and the urban water cycle environment. This paper presents an overview of theory meaning, key principles, and technical architecture of WSUD, and at the same time, ecological ideas of WSUD has been summarized combined with the traditional ecological wisdom, which comprises the ‚Äúall things together‚Äùtheory, the idea of ‚Äúdaofaziran‚Äù(following nature‚Äôs lead), ‚Äúdesign with nature‚Äù, and the idea of ‚Äúecological systems‚Äù. WSUD technologies include green roofs, rain gardens, bioswales, soakaways, wet basins, dry basins, etc. However, to date, few studies have been conducted on the classification of all of the current technologies. In this paper, the WSUD technologies are categorized into three types according to the functions of different technologies: Water Balance, Water Quality, and Water Conservation. For the development of the WSUD worldwide, especially in China, which faces a more serious challenge because of rapid urbanization, further studies on creating technical architecture and summarizing ecological ideas are required. Kaixian Country located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area has become a representative water-sensitive urban area because of the water level control, splitting urbanization speed, and accompanying potential water environment crisis. In order to explore an fitting ecological restoration model to overcome the contradiction between high-speed urbanization and water environment security, this paper employs Kaixian as the example to design the urban water environmental pollution control system, based on the understanding of the ecological ideas of WSUD and the application of the WSUD technology. The whole design was divided into three parts: source control, process control, and receiving water control. The source control mainly used the green roof-ecological wall-rain garden system to decrease the source of pollutants; the process control was divided into four belts: recreation belt, ecological slope belt, landscape dick- pond belt, and natural drawdown belt, different WSUD strategies were implemented for every belt and some possible solutions were proposed for the contaminated urban water bodies. This design includes multi-stripe and multi-function modes that consider not only the physical elements of a place that provide the functional value, but also those elements that create a congenial atmosphere by enhancing the ‚Äòsense of place‚Äô (psychological value). The ‚Äúmulti-tape mode‚Äù will provide a good example of controlling water pollution for other urban areas located in the TGR region.", The water sensitive urban design (WSUD) has evolved from its early association with stormwater management to provide a broader framework for sustainable design and urban water management,None,None
Parametric study of perforated pipe underdrains surrounded by loose aggregate,"Afrin T., Kaye N.B., Khan A.A., Testik F.Y.",Journal of Hydraulic Engineering,2016-12-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. A detailed computational parametric study of a perforated pipe underdrain surrounded by loose aggregate has been conducted. Several controlling geometric parameters (i.e., trench width, head, aggregate depth over the pipe, pipe wall perforation area per unit length of pipe, and the area of individual perforations) were considered and the variation of pipe discharge characteristics as a function of these parameters has been quantified. Results indicate that, for each combination of these parameters, there is a finite pipe length after which discharge does not increase with increasing pipe length. This pipe length depends on the pipe wall perforation area per unit length of pipe, pipe cross-sectional area, and losses associated with them. It was found that the effective pipe system discharge coefficient is independent of the channel width, aggregate depth, and head over the pipe for the range of parameters tested. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results were used to develop an equation for the system discharge coefficient as a function of the pipe geometry. This equation can be used for sizing underdrains in low-impact development (LID) best management practice (BMP) stormwater systems. These results have practical applications in many stormwater LID/BMPs of similar setup to that used in this study (e.g., porous pavements and infiltration trenches) for sizing and analyzing the hydraulic behavior of the underdrains. This allows design engineers to quantify the peak outflow from the underdrain when the systems are flooded."," This pipe length depends on the pipe wall perforation area per unit length of pipe, pipe cross-sectional area, and losses associated with them",None,None
Evaluation of Field Hydraulic Conductivity Data: Comparing Spot Infiltrometer Test Data to Continuous Recession Data,"Zukowski Z., Emerson C.H., Welker A.L., Achey B.",Geotechnical Special Publication,2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, tainable infrastructure research has led to an increase in the use of stormwater control measures (SCM). Rain gardens are vegetated SCMs which promote infiltration, evapotranspiration, or both. As the use of rain gardens and other sustainable practices becomes more common, cost effective techniques are needed to determine site properties for design and to assess their performance after construction. A major component of rain garden performance is hydraulic conductivity, which can be determined by infiltration testing. The double-ring infiltrometer test, while commonly used in practice, can take long periods of time to complete. Single-ring infiltrometer tests often use less water and are require less time to implement, enabling more tests to be completed in the same period of time. Seven small single ring infiltrometer tests were performed at a rain garden on Villanova's campus in Fall 2014 to determine the field hydraulic conductivity of surficial soil in the SCM. The instrumentation at the site used in the field study has been recording the recession rate in the pond over the past twelve years.

"Forensic Analyses of Two Failed Rain Gardens in a Tract Development in Glasgow, Delaware","Garza P.R., Welker A., Rife S.",Geotechnical Special Publication,2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, ASCE. Rain gardens are stormwater control measures (SCMs) that control runoff volume and mitigate pollutants through infiltration and evapotranspiration. Many states have developed manuals to aid in the design and construction of SCMs, including rain gardens. Delaware's manual, the Delaware urban runoff management model, recommends that the following soil mixture be used in rain gardens to achieve percolation within 48 hours of the rain event: 50% construction sand, 20-30% topsoil, and 20-30% mulch. The engineered soils that were designed to meet the Delaware soil mix criterion in two failed rain gardens and two samples of native soils in a tract development in Glasgow, Delaware were examined for this paper. The soils were classified according to the USDA (common in stormwater design) and USCS (common in geotechnical design) classification systems. In addition, the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the soil water characteristic curves were determined. Soil samples from both failed rain gardens were classified as clayey sands (SC), while the native soil samples were classified as silty sands (SM). Soils in the failed rain gardens also had lower hydraulic conductivities compared to the native soils. The presence of clays in the engineered soils of the failed rain gardens impaired their ability to infiltrate, resulting in an unusually long residence time of the captured stormwater. This case study highlights the importance of testing native soils at a proposed site and re-using them if their infiltration capacity is appropriate. In this case, the acceptable native soils were replaced with an inadequate soil mixture resulting in an inferior performance and added expense.",None,None,None
An Iron-Enhanced Rain Garden for Dissolved Phosphorus Removal,"Weiss P.T., Aljobeh Z.Y., Bradford C., Breitzke E.A.","World Environmental And Water Resources Congress 2016: Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater and Urban Watershed Symposium - Papers from Sessions of the Proceedings of the 2016 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress",2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, ASCE. As a stormwater management technique, rain gardens can reduce runoff volume and retain contaminants such as metals found in urban stormwater runoff. Due to organic material in rain gardens such as plants, mulch, and compost, however, rain gardens have been shown to release dissolved phosphorus, which is typically targeted for removal from stormwater. As a result, rain gardens can act as a source of dissolved phosphorus and cause a corresponding increase in the dissolved phosphorus concentration in runoff. This project assesses the performance of an iron-enhanced rain garden with regards to its ability to retain dissolved phosphorus. Studies have shown that iron-enhanced sand filtration has the ability to remove over 90% of dissolved phosphorus from stormwater runoff. A new rain garden design incorporating a layer of sand mixed with iron shavings at 5% (by weight) beneath typical rain garden media was tested under laboratory conditions for its ability to retain dissolved phosphorus. Performance was compared to a control rain garden that contained a layer of only sand beneath typical rain garden media. Preliminary results indicated that the iron-enhanced rain garden consistently retained approximately 90% or more of the dissolved phosphorus load after more than 61 m of water had infiltrated. The control rain garden initially retained over 50% of the dissolved phosphorus load. However, after the same depth of infiltrated water, dissolved phosphorus retention dropped significantly and ultimately became negative."," However, after the same depth of infiltrated water, dissolved phosphorus retention dropped significantly and ultimately became negative",None,None
Nutrient leaching and copper speciation in compost-amended bioretention systems,"Chahal M.K., Shi Z., Flury M.",Science of the Total Environment,2016-06-15,0,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier B.V..Bioretention systems are designed to remove contaminants from stormwater; however, studies have shown that bioretention systems can export excess nitrogen, phosphorus, and copper when amended with compost. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify removal of nitrates, phosphorus, copper, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from compost-amended bioretention systems, and (2) to investigate the role of DOM on the leaching of copper. Simulated bioretention systems were irrigated with stormwater for seven storms in two-weeks intervals. Leachates were analyzed for nutrients, copper, and DOM. Visual MINTEQ was used to determine the speciation of copper and to quantify interactions of copper with DOM. Results showed that compost-amended bioretention systems were a source of nitrates, phosphorus, and DOM. Nitrate and phosphorus amounts were elevated up to three orders of magnitude in the leachate compared to the stormwater itself. Bioretention systems were a source for copper during the first 3-5 storms, but during later storms, they were a sink for copper. Copper speciation modeling indicated that the majority of dissolved copper was complexed with DOM. Dissolved organic matter thus helps to mobilize copper from the compost, particularly in the first few storms after compost application. However, since copper-DOM complexes are usually much less toxic than free copper ions, we expect that compost amendments may reduce harmful effects of copper on aquatic organisms.",None,None,None
Enhancing Stormwater Management Benefits of Rainwater Harvesting via Innovative Technologies,"Gee K.D., Hunt W.F.",Journal of Environmental Engineering (United States),2016-08-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems provide the dual, but often opposing, benefits of acting as alternate water supply sources and providing detention/retention of roof runoff that would otherwise become stormwater runoff. A major challenge that exists when using a RWH system to simultaneously accomplish stormwater and water-conservation benefits in nonarid regions is that these systems are often underutilized, thus remaining full a large portion of the time. For a system to mitigate stormwater runoff, however, there must be sufficient room available in the tank to store a runoff event. Two novel approaches were implemented to improve the ability of RWH systems to serve as both water-conservation practices and stormwater-management practices: an active release technology and a passive release technology. Two locations in Craven County, North Carolina, had RWH systems installed to capture roof runoff and store it for nonpotable uses. One system was equipped with the passive release mechanism, which divided the storage tank into a detention storage volume that was slowly drained between storm events, and a retention storage volume, which was retained for harvesting. The other system included an active release mechanism that automatically released harvested water based on real-time forecasted precipitation and current RWH system conditions. Despite minimal usage, both systems provided substantial stormwater mitigation. The passive release system averaged 82 and 90% volume and peak flow reductions, respectively, while the active release system reduced volumes and peak flows by an average of 91 and 93%, respectively. Both of these mechanisms exhibit great promise in revolutionizing rainwater harvesting system use to meet both water-conservation and stormwater-management goals.",None,None,None
Hydrologic impact of urbanization with extensive stormwater infiltration,"Locatelli L., Mark O., Mikkelsen P.S., Arnbjerg-Nielsen K., Deletic A., Roldin M., Binning P.J.",Journal of Hydrology,2017-01-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier B.V. This paper presents a novel modeling analysis of a 40-year-long dataset to examine the impact of urbanization, with widespread stormwater infiltration, on groundwater levels and the water balance of a watershed. A dataset on the hydrologic impact of urbanization with extensive stormwater infiltration is not widely available, and is important because many municipalities are considering infiltration as an alternative to traditional stormwater systems. This study analyzes groundwater level observations from an urban catchment located in Perth, Western Australia. The groundwater observation data cover approximately a 40-year-long period where land use changes (particularly due to urbanization) occurred; moreover, the monitored area contains both undeveloped and urbanized areas where stormwater infiltration is common practice via soakwells (shallow vertical infiltration wells). The data is analyzed using a distributed and dynamic hydrological model to simulate the groundwater response. The model explicitly couples a soakwell model with a groundwater model so that the performance of the soakwells is reduced by the increase of groundwater levels. The groundwater observation data is used to setup, calibrate and validate a coupled MIKE SHE-MIKE URBAN groundwater model and the model is used to quantify the extent of groundwater rise as a result of the urbanization process. The modeled urbanization processes included the irrigation of new established private and public gardens, the reduction of evapotranspiration due to a decrease in green areas, and the development of artificial stormwater infiltration. The study demonstrates that urbanization with stormwater infiltration affects the whole catchment water balance, increasing recharge and decreasing evapotranspiration. These changes lead to a rise in the groundwater table and an increase in the probability of groundwater seepage above terrain.",None,None,None
Potential climate change impacts on green infrastructure vegetation,"Maria Raquel C.D.S., Montalto F.A., Palmer M.I.",Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,2016-12-01,0,"Copyright, 2016 Elsevier GmbH This study investigated the impacts of successive simulated droughts and floods on two plant species (Carex lurida and Liriope muscari) commonly installed in green-infrastructure (GI) sites built in the urban northeast USA. The instantaneous stomatal conductance, and belowground biomass growth (in a second drought experiment only) were used as metrics, since they are indicators of the ability of plants to provide ecosystem functions such as transpiration and carbon uptake. The results indicate that both species have greater tolerance for floods than for droughts. Signs of stress were only evident after a simulated flood exceeding the duration of 95% of all storms that occurred in this geographic region between 1950 and 2000. By contrast, simulated droughts had a more pronounced effect on both the instantaneous conductance measures during drought and the recovery following the cessation of drought in both species. Liriope subjected to drought treatments were all able to recover and to re-establish stomatal conductance levels similar to those displayed by a control group even after repeated drought treatments. By contrast, Carex showed reduced recovery after multiple droughts, in two separate rounds of experiments. However, regardless of moisture conditions and treatment, Carex generally displayed higher stomatal conductance than Liriope, indicating greater transpiration, and CO2 uptake than Liriope. The belowground biomass results supported this finding, i.e. Carex gained more belowground biomass than Liriope during all experiments. At the end of the experiment, the Carex subjected to drought had less than one sixth the belowground biomass of the control treatment, whereas for Liriope this ratio was only 50% (drought to control). The drought treatments, therefore, reduced the biomass of Carex more than it did Liriope, when compared to the respective control plants. Nonetheless, both species survived repeated cycles of droughts and floods, suggesting that these particular species are both likely suitable for use in GI facilities, despite projected future increases in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts in this geographic region. From a practical perspective, the results suggest no need for irrigation or potential replacement of plants in GI systems in a changed climate.",None,None," Nonetheless, both species survived repeated cycles of droughts and floods, suggesting that these particular species are both likely suitable for use in GI facilities, despite projected future increases in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts in this geographic region"

Earthworms were positively correlated to soil organic matter content, but the abundances of other taxonomic groups were not strongly related to organic matter content, plant cover, or root biomass across sites. While less than 5% of total soil N was estimated to be stored in the body tissues of these three taxa, and estimated N gas emissions from earthworms (N2O and N2) were low, ingestion and processing of soil was high (e.g., up to 417% of the upper 5¬†cm of soil ingested by earthworms annually in one site), suggesting that the contribution of these organisms to N cycling in rain gardens may be substantial.

To respond to the environmental concerns raised by patterns of human development, changing the way that land-use decisions are made, to adopt a sustainable framework is inescapable. In view of this fact, to limit the built environment impact on the natural environment, and therefore to produce a built environment that mimics and complements rather than conflicts with nature is emerging as a vital goal for those who design cities, neighborhoods, and buildings. At the same time, the second important factor for land-use planning is the term ‚Äúlivability‚Äù that describes quality of life and the characteristics of cities that make them livable. Traffic, health, safety, the environment, and many other factors are important to quality of life, and all are influenced in some way by the built environment. The key question of this paper is: whether and to what extent we can integrate environmentally friendly design concepts into our livable neighborhood. To find the relationship between ‚Äúlivability‚Äù and ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù in neighborhood design, this paper first highlights the key elements of livable neighborhoods, and their design components.

Three bioretention cells in Norway were monitored for 23 to 36 months to evaluate the hydrological performance of bioretention cells operated in regions with cold climates and to test if cell size equations can be used to predict hydrological performance. Values of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) were determined for separate events by analyzing the observed infiltration rates and via infiltration tests. The two cells with the highest Ksat values (15.9 and 45.0 cm/h) performed excellently during the study period infiltrating nearly all of the incoming runoff. In contrast, the cell with low Ksat value (1.3 cm/h) infiltrated barely half of the incoming runoff. The latter cell had a clear seasonal variation in hydrological performance relating to changes in the Ksat values over the year.

Effect of composition on basic properties of engineered media for living roofs and bioretention,"Liu R., Fassman-Beck E.",Journal of Hydrologic Engineering,2016-06-01,0,"Copyright, ASCE. Engineered media used in living roofs and bioretention plays a crucial role in determining stormwater mitigation performance. Engineered media with compositions varying in four aggregates, volumetric ratio of compost (0, 10, and 20%) and three amendments (zeolite, paving sand, and topsoil) were prepared in the laboratory. Media basic properties including particle-size distribution (PSD), dry bulk density, particle density, porosity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), were characterized and investigated as a function of the varying composition. All media are classified as poorly-graded sand (SP), exhibiting porosity greater than 0.51, with magnitudes of Ks ranging from 10-2 to 10-1 cm/s. Media with pumice-based aggregates have particle densities between 2.21 and 2.48 g/cm3. The Ks of a pure aggregate classified as SP is positively related to the particle size corresponding to 50% fines on the cumulative PSD curve. Ks values of four aggregates either remain unchanged or decrease by 73% at most with the addition of the compost. An amendment to an aggregate-compost mixture can alter Ks in different ways, depending on its particle shape, coarseness, and organic material.",None,None,None

Evaluating Retention Capacity of Infiltration Rain Gardens and Their Potential Effect on Urban Stormwater Management in the Sub-Humid Loess Region of China,"Tang S., Luo W., Jia Z., Liu W., Li S., Wu Y.",Water Resources Management,2016-02-01,0,"Copyright, 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Recognized as an effective low impact development (LID) practice, rain gardens have been widely advocated to be built with urban landscaping for stormwater runoff reduction through the retention and infiltration processes; but the field performance and regional effect of rain gardens have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we presented a four-year monitoring study on the performance of a rain garden on stormwater retention; hydrological models were proposed to predict the potential effect of rain gardens on runoff reduction under different storms and the future urban development scenarios. The experimental rain garden was constructed in a sub-humid loess region in Xi‚Äôan, China; it has a contributing area ratio of 20:1 and depth of 15¬†cm. During the study period, we observed 28 large storm events, but only 5 of them caused overflow from the rain garden. The flow reduction rate for the overflow events ranged from 77 to 94¬†%. The runoff coefficient from the contributing area (RC) was reduced to less than 0.02 on annual basis, and 0.008 over the four years average. Field observations also showed that infiltration rate remained stable during the operation period. The predictions based on the future landuse and storm variability of the study area showed that by converting a small fraction of the city land area into rain gardens, the negative hydrological effect from expansion of impervious area can be reduced significantly. The challenge, however, lies in how to plan and build rain gardens as an integral part of the urban landscape."," The predictions based on the future landuse and storm variability of the study area showed that by converting a small fraction of the city land area into rain gardens, the negative hydrological effect from expansion of impervious area can be reduced significantly",None,None

The designs of existing BMPs were largely dependent on the state and city's runoff volume requirements, rather than the pollutant removal efficiency of the BMPs. The framework for assessment of the efficiency of a BMP in a cold region was limited, and hence, an initiative was carried out to gauge the performance of the existing BMPs. An assessment plan, including monitoring hydrologic and water quality parameters, was established before the arrival of any spring runoff. Based on the successful captures of the first summer's storm events, the performance of a BMP was assessed. The average removal efficiency of the nutrients was 73% for total phosphorus and 40% for nitrate as nitrogen. Conductivity was found to increase between the influent and the effluent concentrations. Measurements on total suspended solids, phosphate and bacteria showed certain removal efficiency, but were not proven to be statistically significant. Parameters of ammonia as nitrogen, nitrite as nitrogen, total copper, total lead, total zinc, chloride, pH, and dissolved oxygen did not suggest effective removal trends. Attenuations of storm peaks were confirmed. A continuation of the assessment plan was carried out in the second summer using two more automatic samplers. However, inconsistent results were found for cases of incomplete sampling over the full-event times.

Runoff and pollutant export from a LID subdivision in North Carolina,"Line D.E., White N.M.",Journal of Environmental Engineering (United States),2016-01-01,0,"Copyright, 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers. Storm rainfall on and runoff from a 3.35-ha low-impact development (LID) residential subdivision in the Piedmont region of North Carolina were monitored for 6+ years, which included predevelopment, during-development, and postdevelopment phases. Runoff was monitored and sampled at two stations using automated samplers. Along with residences, the drainage area to one of the stations (PC1) included an undisturbed wooded riparian buffer with level spreaders to distribute runoff, while the area to the other station (PC2) included four bioretention areas, permeable pavement, a roof runoff collection system, a detention pond, and other LID measures. Monitoring results documented that the postdevelopment, runoff to rainfall ratio, and pollutant export at both stations were significantly greater than those of the predevelopment phase, during which time the land use on the site was mature woods. The total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS) export at both LID monitoring stations was 23 to 92% less than those from a nearby conventionally-developed subdivision monitored previously. These data indicated that LID subdivisions constructed on moderately to slowly permeable soils may not be able to maintain the runoff to rainfall ratio and TN, TP, and TSS export if the predevelopment land use was mature woods; however, if the predevelopment land use was cropland mixed with woods, then it may be possible to maintain predevelopment runoff to rainfall ratio and TN, TP, and TSS export. Further, the extensive use of LID techniques/measures in this residential subdivision resulted in less TN, TP, and TSS export compared to a similar conventional subdivision."," Monitoring results documented that the postdevelopment, runoff to rainfall ratio, and pollutant export at both stations were significantly greater than those of the predevelopment phase, during which time the land use on the site was mature woods",None,None

Aluminum-based water treatment residual (WTR)-coated wood mulches were synthesized and tested for removal of heavy metals and phosphorus (P) in synthetic urban stormwater. WTRs are an industrial waste produced from coagulation in water treatment facilities, primarily composed of amorphous aluminum or iron hydroxides. Batch tests showed that the composite filter media could effectively adsorb 97% lead (Pb), 76% zinc (Zn), 81% copper (Cu) and 97% P from the synthetic stormwater (Pb = 100 Œºg/L, Zn = 800 Œºg/L, Cu = 100 Œºg/L, P = 2.30 mg/L, and pH = 7.0) within 120 min, due to the presence of aluminum hydroxides as an active adsorbent. The adsorption was a 2nd-order reaction with respect toward each pollutant. Column tests demonstrated that the WTR-coated mulches considerably alleviated the select pollutants under a continuous-flow condition over the entire filtration period. The effluent Pb, Zn, Cu, and P varied at 0.5-8.9%, 33.4-46.7%, 45.8-55.8%, and 6.4-51.9% of their respective initial concentrations with the increasing bed volume from 0 to 50. Synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) tests indicated that leached contaminants were all below the U.S. criteria, suggesting that the release of undesired chemicals under rainfall or landfilling conditions is not a concern during application.

Steel slag adsorbents were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared spectrum (IR spectrum). Adsorption isotherms and kinetics were also analysed. Various parameters were measured in a series of batch experiments, including the sorbent dose, grain size of steel slag, reaction time, initial concentration of nitrate nitrogen, relationship between Al, Fe and Si ions leached from the steel slag and residual nitrate in the aqueous solution. The nitrate adsorbing capacity increased with increasing amounts of steel slag. In addition, decreasing the grain diameter of steel slag also enhanced the adsorption efficiency. Nitrate removal from the aqueous solution was primarily related to Al, Fe, Si and Mn leached from the steel slag. The experimental data conformed to second-order kinetics and the Freundlich isothermal adsorption equation, indicating that the adsorption of nitrate by steel slag is chemisorption under the action of monolayer adsorption.

Characterizing the Effects of Stormwater Mitigation on Nutrient Export and Stream Concentrations,"Bell, Colin D., McMillan, Sara K., Clinton, Sandra M., Jefferson, Anne J.",Environmental Management,2016-12-08,N/A,"Urbanization increases nutrient loading and lowers residence times for processing of reactive solutes, including nitrate, total dissolved nitrogen, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic carbon), which leads to increased stream concentrations and mass export. Stormwater control measures mitigate the impacts of urbanization, and have the potential to improve stream water quality, however the net effect instream is not well understood. We monitored two urban and two suburban watersheds in Charlotte, NC to determine if mitigation controlled the fraction of total mass export during storm, if development classification as either urban or suburban (defined by the age, density and distribution of urban development) controlled storm nutrient and carbon dynamics, and if stormwater control measures were able to change stream water chemistry. While average concentrations during stormflow were generally greater than baseflow, indicating that storms are important times of solute export, the fraction of storm-derived export was unrelated to mitigation by stormwater control measures. Development classification was generally not an important control on export of N and dissolved organic carbon. However, event mean concentrations of orthophosphate were higher at the suburban sites, possibly from greater fertilizer application. Stormwater control measures influenced instream water chemistry at only one site, which also had the greatest mitigated area, but differences between stormwater control measure outflow and stream water suggest the potential for water quality improvements.

In this study, we developed a conceptual model that incorporated human preferences and biophysical processes in a coupled manner to estimate stormwater runoff variation at the sewershed scale under different acceptable GI implementation scenarios. To investigate resident receptivity toward GI implementation, we conducted surveys in selected Syracuse sewersheds and developed the scenario of residents implementing rain barrels and rain gardens in their private properties based on the survey results. We simulated this scenario at the lot level using the model we developed within the framework of the EPA SWMM 5 model to estimate reductions in peak flow and total runoff volume for major storm events. With our model, we also tested the effect of planned government tree planting scenarios.

Metal accumulation and hydraulic performance of bioretention systems after long-term operation,"Kluge, Bj√∂rn, Markert, Arvid, Facklam, Michael, Sommer, Harald, Kaiser, Mathias, Pallasch, Matthias, Wessolek, Gerd",Journal of Soils and Sediments,2016-09-04,N/A,"PurposeStormwater bioretention systems are widely used to treat diffuse infiltration of runoff from paved surfaces and roofs. Substantial questions remain about the hydraulic performance and the accumulation of pollutants in systems over the long term. Data of metal accumulation of systems with operational times >10¬†years currently is limited. This study deals with the accumulation of metals in a variety of long-term operational bioretention systems (11‚Äì22¬†years) to derive further operation recommendations for the water authorities.Materials and methodsThe hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention systems in field was measured using a double ring infiltrometer. Media soil samples from 22 diverse designed systems were collected across the surface and at intervals up to a depth of 65¬†cm to determine the spatial accumulation of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd. Leaching experiments of selected bioretention media soils were derived to assess the metal leachability by water.Results and discussionThe hydraulic performance of most bioretention systems still met the technical guidelines of Germany even after long-term operation. Considerable metal accumulation occurred in the topsoil (0‚Äì20¬†cm). Median concentrations of all metals are highest at the soil surface (0‚Äì10¬†cm), decreasing with increasing depth. High concentrations were determined at the inflow points of the runoff waters, whereas concentrations at more than 1.5¬†m distance from the inflow were only slightly increased compared to the initial soil concentrations. Leachability tests have shown that most of the metals deposited in bioretention soils are only slightly water soluble. No concentrations exceeding the threshold values of the German Soil Contamination Ordinance for the pathway soil to groundwater could be determined.ConclusionsThe hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention systems is given even well after long-term operation. Most of the metal accumulation is concentrated in the top 20¬†cm; concentrations decrease rapidly and mostly reach background/initial concentrations after depths of 30¬†cm. The water-soluble metals are all below the trigger values of the German Soil Act.

Although arguably important to developing solutions for many societal issues, more often than not, students have limited exposure to the geosciences in high school or college. To address this geoscience literacy problem, the Interdisciplinary Teaching of Geoscience for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) Talent Expansion Center has engaged members of the geoscience community and their colleagues in allied disciplines to implement and support strategies to teach geoscience in the context of societal issues and vice versa. Place-based learning is a particularly useful educational practice in helping link geoscience concepts to societal issues and other disciplines. The three examples from three distinctly different institutions of higher education‚ÄîUniversity of Utah, Metropolitan State University, and West Chester University‚Äîdemonstrate the use of place-based educational strategies to connect the geosciences to societal challenges. Each of these courses uses variations of place-based pedagogy to provide students from a variety of disciplines the opportunity to learn about geoscience concepts in the context of environmental challenges in their own area. Each example describes the course in the context of its institutional setting, student audience, type of course, and learning outcomes; the geoscience-related societal challenges addressed, a description of pedagogical strategies, basic assessment information, and reflections on lessons learned and recommendations. These three examples illustrate that local places‚Äîon-campus, the surrounding community, and regional landscapes‚Äîprovide a plethora of opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world issues. The extent to which an instructor will take advantage of the place-based opportunities is only limited by the imagination of the instructor(s) and the extent to which they want to use these pedagogies to achieve their learning objectives. Teaching geoscience in the context of societal issues using place-based educational practices illuminate the process of geoscience and build interdisciplinary problem-solving skills that connect geoscience to economic, societal, and policy issues related to a range of issues.

"Towards a comprehensive green infrastructure typology: a systematic review of approaches, methods and typologies","Bartesaghi Koc, Carlos, Osmond, Paul, Peters, Alan",Urban Ecosystems,2016-07-09,N/A,"There is no consensus on a comprehensive classification for green infrastructure (GI). This is a consequence of the diversity of disciplines, application contexts, methods, terminologies, purposes and valuation criteria for which a GI typology is required. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the existing evidence on how GI is being categorised and characterised worldwide. We reviewed a total of 85 studies from 15 countries that were analysed for contextual trends, methods, parameters and typologies. Results show that relevant literature lacks a common terminology and that a universal typology for all scenarios is impractical. Analysis reveals that GI can be organised into four main GI categories: (a) tree canopy, (b) green open spaces, (c) green roofs and (d) vertical greenery systems (facades/walls). Green open spaces and tree canopy attracted the attention of researchers due to their complexity, variability and important roles in GI planning. Evidence suggests that a ternary approach in terms of the functional (purpose, use, services), structural (morphology) and configurational (spatial arrangements) attributes of GI should be applied for a more comprehensive classification. Although this approximation is inherently generic, since it can be used across different research disciplines, it is also sufficiently specific to be implemented for individual scopes, scenarios and settings.

Sustainable urban drainage systems: examining the potential for green infrastructure-based stormwater management for Sub-Saharan cities,"Mguni, Patience, Herslund, Lise, Jensen, Marina Bergen",Natural Hazards,2016-06-01,N/A,"Green infrastructure (GI)-based approaches to urban drainage such as sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) could provide Sub-Saharan cities with an opportunity to address projected climate change impacts and existing deficits in their drainage infrastructure, even more so due to the synergies between an enhanced green infrastructure stock and sustainable urban development. The objective of this paper was to assess the theoretical value of using green infrastructure for stormwater management as an alternative and supplement to conventional pipe-based stormwater management systems. A SWOT analysis is performed to assess the potential that SUDS hold if adopted and implemented in Sub-Saharan cities. This analysis is based on a review of sustainable stormwater management as well as urban planning and governance literature. Results show that despite seemingly significant barriers to the adoption of SUDS in Sub-Saharan cities such as low prioritization on the urban agenda and lack of data among others, the concept may hold valuable potential for flood risk reduction, even more so due to its multi-functionality and synergies with urban agriculture, amenity and water supply. In the light of the existing threats and weaknesses, it is recommended that GI-based SUDS may be best approached initially as experiments at a local community scale."," Results show that despite seemingly significant barriers to the adoption of SUDS in Sub-Saharan cities such as low prioritization on the urban agenda and lack of data among others, the concept may hold valuable potential for flood risk reduction, even more so due to its multi-functionality and synergies with urban agriculture, amenity and water supply",None,None
Urban Stormwater Governance: The Need for a Paradigm Shift,"Dhakal, Krishna P., Chevalier, Lizette R.",Environmental Management,2016-05-01,N/A,"
Traditional urban stormwater management involves rapid removal of stormwater through centralized conveyance systems of curb‚Äìgutter‚Äìpipe networks. This results in many adverse impacts on the environment including hydrological disruption, groundwater depletion, downstream flooding, receiving water quality degradation, channel erosion, and stream ecosystem damage. In order to mitigate these adverse impacts, urban stormwater managers are increasingly using green infrastructure that promote on-site infiltration, restore hydrological functions of the landscape, and reduce surface runoff. Existing stormwater governance, however, is centralized and structured to support the conventional systems. This governance approach is not suited to the emerging distributed management approach, which involves multiple stakeholders including parcel owners, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. This incongruence between technology and governance calls for a paradigm shift in the governance from centralized and technocratic to distributed and participatory governance. This paper evaluates how five US cities have been adjusting their governance to address the discord. Finally, the paper proposes an alternative governance model, which provides a mechanism to involve stakeholders and implement distributed green infrastructure under an integrative framework.",None,None,None
Vacant urban lot soils and their potential to support ecosystem services,"Herrmann, Dustin L., Shuster, William D., Garmestani, Ahjond S.",Plant and Soil,2016-04-04,N/A,"AimsUrban soils are the basis of many ecosystem services in cities. Here, we examine formerly residential vacant lot soils in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, USA for their potential to provide multiple ecosystem services. We examine two key contrasts: 1) differences between cities and 2) differences within vacant lots created during demolition, specifically pre-existing (i.e., prior to demolition) soils outside of the building footprint and fill soils added within the former building‚Äôs footprint.MethodsDeep soil cores were collected from vacant lots in Cleveland and Detroit. Soil properties that are proxies for three ecosystem services were measured: hydraulic conductivity for stormwater retention, topsoil depth and soil nitrogen (N) level for support for plant growth, and soil carbon (C) content for C storage.ResultsBoth city and soil group contrasts created distinct ecosystem service provisioning based on proxy measures. Cleveland soils had greater hydraulic conductivity and greater soil C and N levels but thinner topsoil layers than Detroit. Within vacant lots of both cities, pre-existing soils had greater soil C and N levels, but lower hydraulic conductivity values than fill soils.ConclusionsSoil properties of vacant lots were generally suitable for providing multiple ecosystem services. City-level differences in soil properties created differences in ecosystem service potential between cities and these differences were evident in pre-existing and fill soils. When comparing between cities, though, fill soils were more similar than pre-existing soils indicating some homogenization of ecosystem service potential with greater redistribution of soil.",None,None,None
Retrofitting LID Practices into Existing Neighborhoods: Is It Worth It?,"Wright, Timothy J., Liu, Yaoze, Carroll, Natalie J., Ahiablame, Laurent M., Engel, Bernard A.",Environmental Management,2016-04-01,N/A,"
Low-impact development (LID) practices are gaining popularity as an approach to manage stormwater close to the source. LID practices reduce infrastructure requirements and help maintain hydrologic processes similar to predevelopment conditions. Studies have shown LID practices to be effective in reducing runoff and improving water quality. However, little has been done to aid decision makers in selecting the most effective practices for their needs and budgets. The long-term hydrologic impact assessment LID model was applied to four neighborhoods in Lafayette, Indiana using readily available data sources to compare LID practices by analyzing runoff volumes, implementation cost, and the approximate period needed to achieve payback on the investment. Depending on the LID practice and adoption level, 10‚Äì70¬†% reductions in runoff volumes could be achieved. The cost per cubic meter of runoff reduction was highly variable depending on the LID practice and the land use to which it was applied, ranging from around $3 to almost $600. In some cases the savings from reduced runoff volumes paid back the LID practice cost with interest in less than 3¬†years, while in other cases it was not possible to generate a payback. Decision makers need this information to establish realistic goals and make informed decisions regarding LID practices before moving into detailed designs, thereby saving time and resources.",None,None,None
Integrated simulation method for waterlogging and traffic congestion under urban rainstorms,"Su, Boni, Huang, Hong, Li, Yuntao",Natural Hazards,2016-03-01,N/A,"Heavy rainstorms are increasingly frequent events in urban areas. Urban rainstorms lead to road waterlogging and low visibility, which affect drivers‚Äô behavior and can thus cause traffic congestion and potential accidents. It is important to study the mechanisms of waterlogging and traffic congestion caused by rainstorms to more effectively predict them and reduce losses. In this paper, an integrated simulation method to analyze the influence of urban rainstorms on waterlogging and traffic congestion was developed. Firstly, waterlogging simulation was conducted to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of water depth on roads based on an urban storm water model. Secondly, psychological questionnaires were distributed to study the drivers‚Äô behavior during a rainstorm. Based on the psychological questionnaires‚Äô results, the vehicles‚Äô speed was estimated under different water depth and visibility conditions. Finally, a microscopic traffic simulation was carried out to predict the traffic condition using the results of the previous two parts. Case studies were conducted on a simplified road model. The effects of different parameters on waterlogging and traffic congestion were analyzed. Then the method was applied to an actual urban area in Beijing, and a detailed waterlogging situation and traffic situation were obtained. Alternate future scenarios of adding drains to mitigate waterlogging and traffic congestion during heavy rainstorms were simulated, and the method‚Äôs potential to assist in decision making for urban drainage system design was shown.

Doing the Hard Work Where it‚Äôs Easiest? Examining the Relationships Between Urban Greening Programs and Social and Ecological Characteristics,"Locke, Dexter H., Grove, J.

Previous research has examined variations in patterns of existing and possible tree canopy cover relative to different social theories. Less attention has been paid to the processes of how the current patterns of tree canopy cover have developed. The goal of this paper is to address this gap by examining current programs to increase tree canopy. This paper utilizes public records, administrative data, a geodemographic market segmentation database, and high-resolution land cover data to assess where programs work, who participates in these programs, and whom the programs fail to reach. Recruiting households to plant trees can be hard work. In this paper, we find that programs might be most successful where it is easiest but have the lowest need. Free or reduced-cost programs for tree planting on private lands were most effective in the most affluent neighborhoods of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD. These areas tended to also have the most existing tree canopy on both private residential lands and the public right of way.

Some have pointed to technological solutions to reduce vulnerabilities and to build resiliency into food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). While technological advances to upgrade human systems, e.g., in agriculture, urban planning, pollution abatement, and green energy development, are critical, these technical advances are insufficient on their own. Effective FEWS management depends on understanding human decision-making, including adaptations to new environmental, social, or economic changes and the responses of individuals and communities to new technologies intended to improve FEWS resilience and sustainability. This paper draws on multiple social science perspectives, including decision science, economics, and sociology, to consider the fundamental role that human behavior and adaptations play in FEWS. We discuss the importance of accounting for human behavior within a coupled human-natural systems framework in which a range of human adaptations and feedbacks are considered, including how humans might respond directly to press-pulse dynamics and indirectly through their adoption of new technology. Following a brief summary of key concepts of decision-making theory at individual and community scales, we then focus on migration and land use changes, the two types of human adaptations that are particularly important for FEWS modeling and management.

Bio-retention Systems for Storm Water Treatment and Management in Urban Systems,"Weerasundara, Lakshika, Nupearachchi, C. N., Kumarathilaka, Prasanna, Seshadri, Balaji, Bolan, Nanthi, Vithanage, Meththika",Phytoremediation,2016-01-01,N/A,"Among different anthropogenic activities, urbanization has greatly influenced the hydrological cycle. Due to increased impervious surfaces, the amount of infiltration has been reduced, thereby increasing the runoff volume leading to flood conditions even for low rainfall events. Storm water flow along these impermeable surfaces finally ends up in surface water reservoirs. Urban systems are fundamentally responsible for a lot of pollutants by different sources: vehicle, industries, atmospheric deposition, soil erosion, etc., which may release various types of pollutants such as metals, organics, nutrients, oil and grease, detergents, surfactants, etc., into the atmosphere. With the storm water runoff, these pollutants may end up in surface waters. This indicates the importance of storm water treatment. Although there are several storm water treatment methods available, low-cost environmental-friendly methods (e.g., bio-retention systems) will be more sustainable with urban systems. Bio-retention systems can manage storm water and improve water quality through containment and remediation of pollutants within the urban system. However, the limitation of these systems is its finite capacity to hold contaminants. Hence, suitable plants grown along the bio-retention systems will be an effective phytoremediation option to address the challenges encountered in these remedial systems.",None,None,None

Phytoremediation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Urban Atmospheric Deposition Using Bio-retention Systems,"Weerasundara, Lakshika, Vithanage, Meththika",Phytoremediation,2016-01-01,N/A,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous compounds in urban environment and pose a great concern in environmental pollution due to their carcinogenicity. The inefficient fuel combustion is the major cause for the emission of PAHs in urban atmosphere. The emitted PAHs are either in particulate or in vapor phase however finally end up with deposition and directed into water reservoirs or groundwater table via storm water. Instead of conventional techniques such as solvent extraction, chemical oxidation, photocatalytic degradation, electrokinetic remediation, and thermal technologies, bio-retention systems can be used to remediate PAHs in storm water. However, bio-retention system does not facilitate the degradation or removal of PAHs, instead it facilitates the accumulation of PAHs in the soil. The use of phytoremediation in bio-retention systems is a hybrid technology that can provide efficient PAH removal by cutting down the biochemical cycling of PAHs. Although phytoremediation and bio-retentions systems are well-established technologies, their combination is rarely used. This chapter discusses the possibility of the use of phytoremediation in bio-retention systems, for remediation of deposited PAHs in the urban environment. Bio-retention systems with phytoremediation not only remediate PAHs but also reduce other pollutants such as heavy metals, nutrients, enhance the esthetic value, and create opportunities to produce biomass for bio-fuel production.",None,None,None
"Irrigating Urban Agriculture with Harvested Rainwater: Case Study in Roanoke, Virginia, USA","Parece, Tammy E., Lumpkin, Malayshia, Campbell, James B.",Sustainable Water Management in Urban Environments,2016-01-01,N/A,"Considered at the global scale, urbanization forms the principal source of landscape change. Worldwide, urban areas are increasing in size, both in land area and in population, causing losses of vegetated lands, increases in impervious surface cover, and increased demands on existing infrastructure and upon municipal services such as water and waste management. Urbanization, by reducing vegetative cover and increasing impervious surfaces, alters hydrologic cycles by reducing infiltration, increasing runoff volume and rates, lowering groundwater tables, decreasing evapotranspiration, and creating precipitation anomalies. Urban greenspaces are recognized as providing environmental benefits, including reduced stormwater runoff, increased evapotranspiration, and increased subsurface infiltration, which, in turn, raise groundwater tables. Urban agriculture forms a greenspace that can provide these environmental benefits, among others, in addition to contributing to food security for local populations. This chapter provides an overview of urban agriculture and its potential benefits. Then, we provide a case study based upon the City of Roanoke, Virginia, USA. We identify areas of existing urban agriculture using aerial imagery. We discuss land available for potential new urban agricultural sites. From aerial images and city geospatial data, we identify and calculate roof areas that can be used to capture rainwater.

The benchmark ambient concentration for a carcinogen (BACC) is the concentration, including an averaging time frame, of a toxic air contaminant that is representative of an additional lifetime cancer risk of one in one million (1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí6). The benchmark ambient concentration for a carcinogen is established pursuant to Regulation 5.20 Methodology for Determining Benchmark Ambient Concentration for a Toxic Air Contaminant, Section 3. The benchmark ambient concentration for the no carcinogenic effects of a toxic air contaminant (BACNC) is the concentration, including an averaging time frame, of a toxic air contaminant that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. The benchmark ambient concentration for the non-carcinogenic effects of a toxic air contaminant is established pursuant to Regulation 5.20 Section 4. A substance can have both, with different values.

The Smart Building in the Smart City,"Stieninger, Petra",Integration of Nature and Technology for Smart Cities,2016-01-01,N/A,"Technologies enable us to make buildings more energy-efficient, more water-efficient, or in general more resource-efficient and sustainable. We design buildings with high-performance appliances that reduce the use of resources tremendously. We incorporate features that allow the building to produce more energy than it uses. And we install smart meters and integrate the Internet of Things to analyze big data on the efficiency of the building operation. Today, we create so-called smart buildings.",None,None,None
A Revolutionary Journey,"Everard, Mark",The Ecosystems Revolution,2016-01-01,N/A,"‚ÄòA revolutionary journey‚Äô explores how an ecosystems revolution is already under way, as evidenced by incremental modifications to the broader formal and informal policy environment of the developed world over the past century and more. The dependencies and impacts of major policy areas on ecosystems and their services are reviewed through selected examples, emphasising the need for far greater internalisation of the benefits and vulnerabilities of supporting ecosystems, integrated across policy spheres and societal sectors, if continuing human opportunity is to be secured.",None,None,None
"Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc.: The Rural Cooperative Perspective","Reilly, Michalene",Sustainable Electricity,2016-01-01,N/A,"Making the business case for sustainability is far easier for large utilities that have either investors or a significant customer base pressuring particular actions. The business case is more difficult when those drivers are absent, as is the case for small non-investor-owned utilities (non-IOUs). For large non-IOUs, there is still pressure to respond to stakeholders and an extensive customer base, but it is more challenging to promote sustainability inside smaller organizations, such as rural electric cooperatives. Hoosier Energy, located in Bloomington Indiana, has been implementing programs to support its communities since its founding in 1949 but has only recently begun to frame these programs as¬†continuous improvement. It took the development of a plan for new headquarters facilities to help¬†bring all the pieces together into a theme that made sense for Hoosier Energy. The Hoosier Energy story is presented as an example of garnering support for a¬†comprehensive program within a¬†generation and tranmission cooperative .",Making the business case for sustainability is far easier for large utilities that have either investors or a significant customer base pressuring particular actions,None,None
Urban Stormwater Management: Evolution of Process and Technology,"Hirschman, David, Battiata, Joseph",Sustainable Water Management in Urban Environments,2016-01-01,N/A,"The practice of urban stormwater management has evolved over the course of several decades. Initially, stormwater management concerned itself primarily with abating downstream flooding and was the sole domain of engineers. As the regulatory climate changed over time, so did design philosophy, along with the types of management practices, the computational m
